Through my experience in the banking industry, I was exposed to many different sectors and businesses. Although I enjoyed the exposure and experience, I ultimately  felt constrained by the restrictions of the field. I wished to dig deeper into the underlying trends and patterns to get more insight, which lead me to Data Science. I am fascinated by the intersection of Finance and Data Science, but also have a life-long love of  NBA statistics, and a passion for sustainability and alternative energy.
