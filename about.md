Through my experience in the banking industry, I was exposed to many different sectors and businesses. I developed real world exposure and experience, which led me to Data Science, so I could dig deeper into the underlying trends and patterns. I am intrigued by the career opportunities at the intersection of Business, Strategy and Data Science, and the application of tech to best satisfy customer needs. I love working with many different teams and individuals with varying strengths in order to synthesize solutions that are best for both company and client. I am a life-long learner who is currently pursuing ongoing skill development through Udemy to compound skills in SQL, Big Data, and Cloud Computing.

In addition to my career interests, I have had the priviledge to travel to over twenty countries in the world. I enjoy getting out of my comfort zone and trying out new things. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, staying active by playing sports like basketball, soccer, skiing and cycling. I  have a passion for sustainability and alternative energy, as well as a love (bordering on obsession) of NBA statistics.
